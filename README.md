# Blindless
Blindless is a convenient and effective platform to identify criminals, lost children, and strangers in the shopping center, as well as to facilitate the work of firefighters in determining the exact number of people in the boutiques of the shopping center during a fire.

The project connects Python program, firebase backend, and iOS-based swift app for information exchange.
